# Password-Generator-and-XOR-cipher

Developed a secure password generator and encryption tool using C++ that combines user-specified words with randomly selected numbers and special characters to create unique passwords. Implemented an XOR cipher encryption algorithm to allow users to encrypt the generated password with a custom key, adding an extra layer of security. Utilized the C++ Standard Library, including std::string, std::set, and std::vector, to handle user input, password creation, and encryption. The project demonstrates a solid understanding of cryptographic techniques, randomization, and secure software development practices, showcasing both problem-solving skills and the ability to integrate encryption for data obfuscation.
